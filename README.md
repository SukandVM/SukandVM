I am Sukand V M but you can call me WyrmyCrawl! Technology has always interested me, and so I set on a journey to grind and build up my tech muscles. I work primarily on AI and deep learning models with a special interest in bridging AI and video games. I have worked on Unity too. TensorFlow and Keras are some of the tools I work with and recently I used smolagents, an AI agent framework designed by HuggingFace. Hope you have fun exploring my repositories and feel free to contribute.
